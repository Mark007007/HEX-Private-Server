"""AI opponent logic (turn driving, playing, attacking).

The AI has no client, so every action is resolved server-side and pushed as
events. All functions take ``handler`` (the hconnect_server connection) first,
mirroring ability.py — they reach back into the handler for card data helpers
(``_card_full_data``, ``_fresh_game``, ``_db``) and push events onto the shared
``game``.

Personality: aggressive. When the AI controls an eligible troop it enters
combat and attacks the player with ALL of its eligible troops.
